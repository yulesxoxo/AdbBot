These steps apply to **ALL** Android devices, regardless of brand:

### Step 1: Enable Developer Options

3. **Find "Build number"** (location varies by brand - see brand-specific sections below)
4. **Tap "Build number" 7 times rapidly**
    - You'll see countdown: *"You are now X steps away from being a developer"*
    - After 7 taps: *"You are now a developer!"* or *"Developer mode has been enabled"*
